## ðŸ›  Installing and running tests

1.**Make sure** that the `TestDataBaseSchema` project is included in the `DatabaseSchema.sln` solution.
2. Run tests from the solution root:
   ```bash
  cd <path to solution>
   dotnet test
   ```
3. To run tests from just this project, use:
   ```bash
   dotnet test TestDataBaseSchema/TestDataBaseSchema.csproj
   ```
4.In Visual Studio, open **Test Explorer** (Test â†’ Test Explorer) and click **Run All**.


## âœ… Result

- The tests **pass**, demonstrating that the `EmployeeService` implementation is correct.
- The project can be expanded with additional scenarios and negative test cases.
